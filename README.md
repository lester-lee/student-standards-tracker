# Student Standards Tracker
Hi! I'm [Lester Lee](https://www.lester-lee.com), and this is my final project for [DATA73200: Interactive Data Visualization](https://gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Masters-Programs/Data-Analysis-and-Visualization), taught by [Ellie Frymire](http://elliefrymire.com/) in Fall 2021.

This is a proof-of-concept project for an app that can be used by educators to keep track of student progress in their courses, as well as to provide accessible and visual feedback to students.

The project can be viewed [at this link](https://www.lester-lee.com/student-standards-tracker/).

More information about this project and my process can be found on the [portfolio page](https://www.lester-lee.com/Interactive-Data-Vis-Fall2021/project/).
